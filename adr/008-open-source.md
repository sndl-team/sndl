## Status

Accepted

## Context

We would like to use many features of github that arent available to private
projects. 

## Decision

We have decided to open source the project so we may utilitze:

- travis ci
- codefactor
- protected branches
- codecov (potentially)

## Consequences

Our code is open to the world for better or worse.
