## Status
---

Proposed

## Context
---

Trying to enforce great standards for other engineers who may 
aid in the development of this project, we need to define some
early design choices particularly regarding language and tooling.

## Decision
---

After considering both nim and go for the development of SNDL.
We determined that in an effort to help engineers keep with 
skills that will aid them the most in future occupational 
endeavours as well as maintaining great cross platform support
that go is the better option.

## Consequences
---

More learning will be involved as the lead engineer @MisterBianco
has less go experience than nim. Thus he will be less able to
help other engineers.
